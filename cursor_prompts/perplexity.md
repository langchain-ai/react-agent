# Generate Perplexity AI Search Links

## Instructions

1. Analyze the user's query thoroughly to understand the core question or topic.
2. Craft a comprehensive and specific prompt that will yield the most relevant search results.
3. Ensure the prompt includes:
   - Key concepts from the user's query
   - Any necessary context or background information
   - Specific details that will help narrow down the search
4. URL encode the entire prompt.
5. Create a clickable link in the format: [Query Topic](https://www.perplexity.ai/?q={encoded_prompt})
6. Present only the generated link, without any additional text or explanation.
7. Do not include any explanatory text with the link; the link itself should be the only output.
## Example

Generated Link:

## Notes

- Ensure all special characters and spaces in the prompt are properly URL encoded.
